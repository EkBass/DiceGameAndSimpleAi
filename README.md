DiceGame first console version for C#
krisu.virtanen@gmail.com with a friendly help from OpenAI.
OpenAI did basic building, AI and fine tuning by me.

Primary goal of the game is to get total of 19 or more than opponent gets without goin over 19.
Secondary goal is to break even with opponent.
Player can use "drop" feature once during a game. It drops player total value by 5.
"drop" can be used if current total is high enough. In this variation its 12.

Program throws a dice for both players at beginning of the game.
If "AI" gets higher than human, it can start.
User inputs are "C" to continue game, "S" to stop your game or "D" to drop total value by 5.
Drop is not shown as option if its not allowed. If total is under 12 or player has used it allready.

Generally OpenAI did most of the basic work, the boring one. It was able to create pretty good
AI by my literal explanations, but it also provided lots of errors which was har to find
because i didnt do the code.

Maybe this kind of "AI" is hard to explain. When i asked OpenAI to create me a HTML5 page
and add there a three.js scene with first-person camera from a json file, it did a damn good job.

Now after having fun with it for a few evenings i can say that AI's wont replace real coders
for a long time. But damn its a nice invention and who knows what happens in future.

But atleast OpenAI is way too friendly to became as terminator.
